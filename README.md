# sorted_binary_node

## Introduction
In this Project, Python and algorithms that work on binary and N-ary trees to sort data and draw organized charts are used. In the project we will store, find, and remove data in sorted trees.

## Techniques Employed
1.) Classes that are used to build linked data structures, such as trees and networks
2.) Recursion
3.) Searching and traversing trees
4.) Adding and removing values from sorted binary trees

## Project Outline
1.) Node Classes
2.) Outline Views
3.) Searching
4.) Traversals
5.) Drawing
6.) Org Charts
7.) Updating Sorted Trees
