# sorted_binary_node

## Introduction
In this Project, Python and algorithms that work on binary and N-ary trees to sort data and draw organized charts are used. In the project we will store, find, and remove data in sorted trees.

## Techniques Employed
1.) Classes that are used to build linked data structures, such as trees and networks <br />
2.) Recursion <br />
3.) Searching and traversing trees <br />
4.) Adding and removing values from sorted binary trees <br />

## Project Outline
1.) Node Classes <br />
2.) Outline Views <br />
3.) Searching <br />
4.) Traversals <br />
5.) Drawing <br />
6.) Org Charts <br />
7.) Updating Sorted Trees <br />
